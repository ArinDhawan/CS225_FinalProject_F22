# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
    Our team shall host weekly meetings whose timing and location will be determined during the prior meeting. The first of these will occur from Nov 4 2022. Each meeting will be no more than an hour, as their purpose is solely to inform all members of the prior week’s progress and establish the next week’s goals. We will use Zoom to conduct these meetings if a member is unable to physically attend. And, at the conclusion of each meeting, members must 1. Send a text outlining all action items and their assignees to the group’s main chat 2. Agree upon the next meeting’s time and location.
2. **Assistance** 
    Documentation of communication is invaluable. As such, all communication regarding the team project will be conducted in the methods mentioned below. Per this document, our team will have these means of communication: SMS Groupchat, GitHub Pull Requests. General discussion will take place within the Groupchat. Technical discussion will take place within the GitHub Pull Request system. All members are expected to be actively involved in both locations, defined as acknowledging an @’s within 24 hours. Acting upon a message, although encouraged, is not required given a reasonable excuse.
3. **Respect** 
    The main priority within team communication is efficiency -- where-ever applicable. To avoid confusion, our team will follow the guidelines mentioned in Assistance. The next important aspect is conflict remedy. It is inevitable that some action items will not be completed by their deadlines. These situations will be addressed according to the team ideal mentioned in the first line of this section. Meaning, these situations will be documented, discussed, and resolved without judgement.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
    The workload for this project will we distributed regarding the following in this priority: individual availability, individual strengths, individual desires. Meaning, an action item is assigned firstly by each member’s availability. For tie-breakers, it is then assigned by the remaining member’s strength in the action item’s domain. For further ties, individual desires are considered. It is unreasonable for a member to have no availability during the team project. As a result, all members are expected to take on multiple action items over the course of the team project.
5. **Time Commitment** 
    Each member is required to commit a minimum of one hour of work per week to the team project. Meaning, this minimum is satisfied by attending the weekly team meeting. But, members are encouraged to commit at most two hours to each weekly action item. Conflicts arising from discussion of time commitment will be addressed per Comminication::Respect. In brief, the team will prioritize the completion of delayed action items without judgement to the context from which they arose over the course of resolving these inevitable conflicts.
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
    Following the language of Communication::Respect, disagreement between members will be resolved without judgement and with the highest priority going towards the efficiency of the team. Regarding delayed action items, these situations will be discussed as a team. And the team will come to a consensus as to whether the action items will be reassigned and their new deadlines. Regarding disagreement between members of the team, a meeting to discuss resolutions to the disagreement. It is critical that all members attend this meeting. At the resolution meeting each member will present their individual perspective of the situation. And each member will give a proposed solution to this situation. At the conclusion of each viewpoint and proposal, members not directly involved in the situation will attempt at a resolution. When either all members are involved in the situation or a resolution cannot be made, as a team we will contact our team’s staff representative if not already done so and request their input to the situation.
